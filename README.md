# PersonalLibrary
Hello!

PersonalLibrary is a database used to add and remove entries from a CSV file of one's personal library contents. 

<b>To run this code, find the file slb6_FinalSubmission.py, and run it in your favorite python environment. The code can run without any additional files, particularly if you are starting a library collection from scratch. 

If you would like to have a base collection of entries to play with, save the file PersonalLibrary.csv alongside slb6_FinalSubmission.py . 
</b>

To see much of my trial and error along the way, check out slb6_Final_CheckIn.py and slb6_Final_CheckIn_2.py .
